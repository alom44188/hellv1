## FAQ

#### Is this tool perfect?

No.

#### Can we improve it somehow?

Totally! This is just an initial implementation and I would love to hear ideas and merge
pull requests in.

#### I have code that couldn't be detected as complex enough, but I believe it is. What do we do?

That's actually awesome! Please open a new issue with the code and explain why you
think it's giving you a wrong result. From there we can start a discussion and improve the
tool.
